When I registered here, the server gave me a backup code
And I can change the password with the backup code
I made a lot of accounts like below

username | backup code | user id |
  user1  |      9      |    19   |
  user2  |     22      |    20   |
  user3  |     30      |    21   |
  user4  |     66      |    22   |
  user5  |     31      |    23   |
  user6  |     51      |    24   |

The backup code seems to be 1~100 random value

But there was count for wrong try for each account
IDK, Just do it anyway

I made a script to brute-force backup code(brute-force.sh) and the result is (brute-result.txt)
